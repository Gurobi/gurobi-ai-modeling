# Contributing Guide

We value your experience in using `gurobi-ai-modeling` and would like to encourage
you to contribute directly to the project.

## How to report bugs or submit feature requests

If you encounter an error, bug, or misrepresentation, or if you want to contribute a 
usage example, please first open an issue to the `gurobi-ai-modeling`
[issue tracker](https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-ai-modeling/issues).

When reporting a bug, please include a minimal reproducible example, including
the installed version of the package and its dependencies.

## Submitting changes

We welcome your contribution in directly tackling some of the issues.

We use the GitHub pull request workflow. Once your pull request is ready for review, one
of the core maintainers of `gurobi-ai-modeling` will review your pull request.

A pull request should include a clear message outlining the changes done, and should be linked 
to an existing issue.

## Code reviews

The pull request author should respond to all comments received. If the comment
has been accepted and appropriate changes applied, the author should respond by
a short message such as "Done" and then resolve the comment. If more discussion
is needed on a comment, it should remain open until a solution can be figured
out.
