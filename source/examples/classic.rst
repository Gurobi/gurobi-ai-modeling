Classic OR Examples
===================

The examples on this page are considered classic OR examples. Historically, we have published the code for these
examples on the `Examples <https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/examples/en/current/exampleview.html>`__ page in our
documentation.

For this AI modelling project, we have translated these models back into problem descriptions. Note that
the model generated by the LLM might not reflect Gurobi's best practices. For the best practices we recommend
looking at the model code in the `Examples <https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/examples/en/current/exampleview.html>`__
page.

Facility
----------------

Simple facility location model: given a set of plants and a set of warehouses, with transportation costs between them,
this example finds the least expensive set of plants to open in order to satisfy product demand.
