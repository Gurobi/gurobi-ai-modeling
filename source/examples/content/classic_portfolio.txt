I have data on some stocks that I enclosed in a csv.

The columns are the stocks and rows are their value at different time points.

Step 1: I want to calculate the minimum risk portfolio
Step 2: Solve for efficient frontier by varying the expected return.
Step 3: Create a plot with the following
  - Volatility versus expected return for individual stocks (in blue dots) and include an annotation with the stock name
  - Volatility versus expected return for minimum risk portfolio (in green dots)
  - Efficient frontier showing the volatility (green line)

Make sure you set: `model.setParam("OutputFlag", 0)`, to suppress Gurobi output.
