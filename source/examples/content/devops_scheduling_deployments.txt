As a DevOps engineer, you are responsible for scheduling deployments throughout the day while minimizing the maximum load on the servers at any given time. You have data on the expected load during the day from regular customer usage, which consumes part of the available load on the servers. Additionally, you have several deployments planned, each with its own load requirements and duration.

The challenge is to schedule these deployments such that the load deviation on the servers is minimized. You also need to ensure that the load never surpasses 100%.

Objective: Minimize the total deviation from the average load on the servers.

Constraints:
- All deployments have to be executed and each deployment must be scheduled during its specified time window.
- The total load at any given time (customer load + deployment load) should not exceed the server capacity.
- Deployments must be non-preemptive (i.e., once started, a deployment must run to completion).
