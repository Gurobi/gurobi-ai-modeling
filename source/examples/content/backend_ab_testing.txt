You are a backend engineer at a software company preparing to conduct A/B tests on a new feature. The goal is to determine the optimal selection of three out of ten possible test variants (V1 to V10) and allocate different user segments to these chosen variants.

Objective:
Minimize the total user disruption

- Selection constraint: Choose three out of ten possible variants.
- Minimum users for statistical significance: Each chosen variant must have at least 100 users in each user segment.
- Total users: Make all users from each segment are allocated to the variants that end up being chosen.
- Balance constraint: Within each user segment, the difference of allocation between any two variants cannot be more than 300

Data:
The user segments and disruptions can be found in backend_ab_testing.csv and has the following columns: User Segment,Total Users,Disruption in V1,Disruption in V2,Disruption in V3,Disruption in V4,Disruption in V5,Disruption in V6,Disruption in V7,Disruption in V8,Disruption in V9,Disruption in V10
