A DevOps Engineer is responsible for scheduling workloads on a limited number of onsite machines. Each machine has specific capacities in terms of virtual CPUs (vCPU), RAM, and GPU FLOPS. Each workload requires a certain amount of these resources to run. The goal is to optimally allocate the workloads to the machines such that all workloads are scheduled without exceeding the capacities of any machine.

Objective: For machines that have 1 or more workloads assigned, minimize the remainder of available resources (the sum of vCPU, RAM and GPU)

Constraints:

    vCPU constraint: The total vCPU requirement of the workloads assigned to a machine must not exceed the vCPU capacity of that machine.
    RAM constraint: The total RAM requirement of the workloads assigned to a machine must not exceed the RAM capacity of that machine.
    GPU FLOPS constraint: The total GPU FLOPS requirement of the workloads assigned to a machine must not exceed the GPU FLOPS capacity of that machine.
    All workloads must be scheduled.
