You are a backend engineer at an e-commerce company tasked with optimizing pricing strategies for a range of electronic products. Your goal is to maximize the total revenue while considering the supply, demand, customer behavior and shipping costs.

Objective: Maximize total revenue
Constraints:

- Stock Availability: The total quantity of each product sold cannot exceed the available stock.
- Demand Elasticity: The demand for each product decreases as the price increases. Use the demand elasticity equation for this.
- Shipping Costs: Shipping costs are deducted from the revenue and vary based on the product size and weight. Use the shipping costs equation for this.
- Minimum Price Constraint: Prices must be at least 80% of the base price to ensure profitability.

Equations:
- Demand elasticity: Q = Q0 * (1 - E * ((P-P0)/P0)) with Q being the demand, Q0 base demand, P0 base price, P new price and E the price elasticity
- Shipping costs: SC = Base Shipping Cost+(2×Size (kg))+(1.5×Weight (kg))
