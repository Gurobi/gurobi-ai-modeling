You are a Backend Engineer tasked with optimizing the configuration and routing rules of an API gateway to ensure efficient handling of requests, reduce latency, and improve the reliability of backend services. The API gateway routes incoming requests to different backend services, each with varying processing times, reliability, and costs. Your goal is to distribute the requests in such a way that minimizes the total latency while meeting the reliability requirements and keeping the cost within budget.

You have five backend services (Service A, Service B, Service C, Service D, and Service E) and need to determine the percentage of requests to route to each service. Each service has a known average processing time, reliability rate, and cost per request. After the initial routing to these backend services, the requests are then routed to a second layer of gateways (F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N), with specific routes between the initial services and the internal gateways. Each route has an associated additional processing time, reliability rate, and cost per request.

Objective: Minimize the total latency of the API gateway system.

Constraints:

- Backend Reliability constraint: The weighted reliability of the Backend Services must be at least 99.5%.
- Internal Reliability constraint: The weighted reliability of the Internal Gateways must be at least 99.5%.
- Backend Routing constraint: The sum of the routing percentages to the Backend Services must equal 100% and no route may take up more than 40%.
- Internal Routing constraint: For each of the routes starting at the same Backend Service, the sum of the routing percentages must equal 100% and no route may take up more than 75%. This means we need to have separate constraints for routes starting at A,B,C,etc.
- Cost constraint: The average cost across all requests must not exceed $0.40.
- Non-negativity constraint: The routing percentages must be non-negative.
- Routing constraints between layers: Specific backend services can only route to certain gateways as defined in the data.

Data:
The Backend Services can be found in network_routing_backend.csv and has the following columns: Service,Average Processing Time (ms),Reliability (%),Cost per Request ($)
The Routing from Backend Services to Internal Gateways can be found in network_routing_internal.csv and has the following columns: Backend Service,Internal Gateway,Additional Processing Time (ms),Additional Reliability (%)
