You are a DevOps Engineer responsible for developing an optimized incident response plan to prioritize critical systems and allocate resources efficiently during outages.
You need to plan the recovery of all 60 interconnected systems as far as possible.
Each system has dependencies on other systems, and only systems with higher numbers (customer-facing systems) have priority scores.

The goal is to get systems with a priority score up and running as quickly as possible. We start at t=0, and the time required for every recovery is indicated by "Recovery Time (minutes)".
As time goes by, value of each system goes down. The value of a system at time t can be calculated via the following function:
V(t)=V0⋅e^−0.0398t with t being the time the system has finished recovering and V0 being the initial priority score.

Objective: Maximize the total of priority scores given the above function.

Data:
The systems and their dependencies can be found in incident_response.json and has the following fields: System, Priority, Dependencies, Recovery Time (minutes)
