A DevOps Engineer is responsible for scheduling workloads on a limited number of onsite machines. Each machine has specific capacities in terms of virtual CPUs (vCPU), RAM, and GPU FLOPS. Each workload requires a certain amount of these resources to run.

Objective: Maximize the total resources of machines without any workloads assigned to them.

Constraints:
- vCPU constraint: The total vCPU requirement of the workloads assigned to a machine must not exceed the vCPU capacity of that machine.
- RAM constraint: The total RAM requirement of the workloads assigned to a machine must not exceed the RAM capacity of that machine.
- GPU FLOPS constraint: The total GPU FLOPS requirement of the workloads assigned to a machine must not exceed the GPU FLOPS capacity of that machine.
- All workloads must be scheduled.

Data:
The machines can be found in assigning_workloads_machines.csv and has the following columns: Machines,vCPU Capacity,RAM Capacity (GB),GPU Capacity (GFLOPS)
The workloads can be found in assigning_workloads_workloads.csv and has the following columns: Workloads,vCPU Requirement,RAM Requirement (GB),GPU Requirement (GFLOPS)
