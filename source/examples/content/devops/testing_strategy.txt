A DevOps Engineer wants to optimize the testing strategy for a software application. The application needs to be tested on four operating systems: Linux64, Armlinux64, MacOS, and Windows. Each operating system must be tested once. There are 10 testing environments available, numbered from 1 to 10, and each OS must be assigned a unique testing environment. Additionally, there are 40 testing machines, with 10 machines dedicated to each OS. Each machine can only handle a subset of the testing environments.

The goal is to find the optimal combination of {machine, testing environment} for each operating system to maximize the total score. The score for each {machine, testing environment} combination is calculated by taking the number of days since the Testing Date and then multiplying that number by its modifier.

Objective: Maximize the total score.

Constraints:
- Each operating system (Linux64, Armlinux64, MacOS, Windows) must be tested exactly once on one of their OS-specific machines.
- Each testing environment can be chosen at most once.
- Each {machine, testing environment} combination can only be chosen if the machine supports the given environment.

Data:
Use the data from devops_testing_strategy.csv with the following columns: OS,Testing Environment,Machine,Testing Date,Modifier
The data also show which combination of {machine, testing environment} are available.
