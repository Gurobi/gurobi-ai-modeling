Example prompts
===============

In the following pages we demonstrate some example applications from a small number of personas. The example prompts
have been proven to work and can thus be used as a template for defining your own problems.

Note that the "Example generated model" outputs do not necessarily reflect Gurobi's best modeling practices. It is
merely an example of what the LLM generated for us. This example should get you on your way to solving your first
optimizing problem. As you get more comfortable with the ``gurobipy`` API, in time, you will learn how to construct
better models.

Also note that not all the example prompts are created equal, meaning that some are easier for the LLM to turn into a
valid model than others. You might find that some of the examples give a correct model every time, while another
might take a few tries.
