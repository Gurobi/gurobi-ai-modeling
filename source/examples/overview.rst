Example prompts
===============

In the following pages we demonstrate some example applications from a small number of personas. The example prompts
have been proven to work and can thus be used as a template for defining your own problems.

Note that the "Example generated model" outputs do not necessarily reflect Gurobi's best modelling practices. It is
merely an example of what the LLM generated for us. This example should get you on your way to solving your first
optimizing problem. As you get more comfortable with the ``gurobipy`` API, in time, you will learn how to construct
better models.
