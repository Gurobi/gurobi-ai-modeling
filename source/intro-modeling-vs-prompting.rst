Model Writing vs. Prompting
===================================================================

An optimization problem must be translated to a mathematical formulation or code in order to solve for the optimal solution. 
The mathematical language used to translate a problem description into an optimization model is well defined - this is the realm of operations research and mathematical programming.  
Below, we review the key elements of this process. 


Importance of a Clear Problem Statement
-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem statements are the foundation of any optimization application, whether you plan to write the mathematical formulation and code yourself or use a custom GPT to help with the translation.  
A well posed problem statement will include all of the kep components of an optimization model (described below) in a readable format and clearly describe the decision to be made. 
The benefits of devoting time to crafting a problem statement for your application include:

- Aligning multiple stakeholders and setting expectations
- Identifying any competing objectives
- Documentation around your application 


Components of an Optimization Model
------------------------------------------

Variables, constraints, objective, data ...


Translation of Problem Statement into Mathematical Formulation: Two Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two options: construct the model by hand, or with assistance from ChatGPT.
We will describe and contrast both approaches...

Review, Validate and Iterate
-------------------------------

However the model was constructed, we will still need to review the results ...
