Model Writing vs. Prompting
===================================================================

An optimization problem must be translated to a mathematical formulation or code in order to solve for the optimal solution. 
The mathematical language used to translate a problem description into an optimization model is well defined - this is the realm of operations research and mathematical programming.  
Below, we review the key elements of this process. 


Importance of a Clear Problem Statement
-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem statements are the foundation of any optimization application, whether you plan to write the mathematical formulation and code yourself or use a custom GPT to help with the translation.   
The benefits of devoting time to crafting a problem statement for your application include:

- Aligning multiple stakeholders and setting expectations
- Identifying any competing objectives
- Documentation around your application 

A well posed problem statement will include all of the kep components of an optimization model (described below) in a readable format and clearly describe the decision to be made. It should also include:

- Description of relationships beween veriables, where needed
- ?
- ?
- ?

Components of an Optimization Model

Understanding the key components of an optimization model is critical when reviewing formulations and code generated by a custom GPT.  

The main components of an optimization model are:

- **Objective:** The goal of your application.  For example, 'minimize cost' or 'maximize reliability'.  
- **Decision Variables:** The set of variables representing the choice that must be made.  For example, 'production rate' or 'machine on/off status'.  Note that a variables' allowed set of values can be continuous(i.e., any number in a specified range), integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.), or binary (i.e., 0 or 1). 
- **Constraints:** The tradeoffs and limitations that must be accounted for, and criteria that must be satisfied. For example, 'no more than 3 workers scheduled any day' or 'at least 100 units in inventory at all times'.  
- **Parameters and Data:** The input data required to not just run the model, but to make the model represent exactly the situation at hand.  For example, 'price of '


Translation of Problem Statement into Mathematical Formulation: Two Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two options: construct the model by hand, or with assistance from ChatGPT.
We will describe and contrast both approaches...

Review, Validate and Iterate

However the model was constructed, we will still need to review the results ...
