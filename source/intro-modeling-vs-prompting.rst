Model Writing vs. Prompting
===================================================================

An optimization problem must be translated to a mathematical formulation or code in order to solve for the optimal solution. The mathematical language used to translate a problem description into an optimization model is well defined - this is the realm of operations research and mathematical programming.  Below, we review the key elements of this process. 



Importance of a Clear Problem Statement
-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem statements are the foundation of ...


Components of an Optimization Model
------------------------------------------

Variables, constraints, objective, data ...


Translation of Problem Statement into Mathematical Formulation: Two Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two options: construct the model by hand, or with assistance from ChatGPT.
We will describe and contrast both approaches...

Review, Validate and Iterate
-------------------------------

However the model was constructed, we will still need to review the results ...
