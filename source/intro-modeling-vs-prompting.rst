Model Writing vs. Prompting

An optimization problem must be translated to a mathematical formulation or code in order to solve for the optimal solution. 
The mathematical language used to translate a problem description into an optimization model is well defined - this is the realm of operations research and mathematical programming.  
Below, we review the key elements of this process. 


Importance of a Clear Problem Statement
-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem statements are the foundation of any optimization application, whether you plan to write the mathematical formulation and code yourself or use a custom GPT to help with the translation.   
The benefits of devoting time to crafting a problem statement for your application include:

- Aligning multiple stakeholders and setting expectations
- Identifying any competing objectives
- Documentation around your application 

A well-posed problem statement should include all of the key components of an optimization model (described below), including information about:

- Which decisions are being made? 
- What constraints or restrictions are there regarding which values of these decisions are allowed or forbidden?
- How can we measure which set of decisions is better, when we have multiple different feasible choices for the decisions? Are we trying to minimize or maximize something?

Although a problem statement need not explicitly contain mathematical notation, inequalities or functions, having a precise and complete description of the above information will make it easier for a human (or AI agent) to construct a mathematical model that accurately represents the problem.

In most cases data should be separated from the model, allowing the problem to be defined in a general or abstract way (e.g., "Determine how much of each product should be produced at each facility.").
Then, after a mathematical model is constructed, specific sets of data (e.g., a spreadsheet or text file containing a list of facilities, a list of products, cost and demand data) can be loaded as input to construct and solve individual instance of the decision problem. 
Separation of the abstract problem description and problem problem data allows problems to be more simply stated, and reused with different data sets.

Components of an Optimization Model

Educational resources for learning about optimization, model writing, and how the

Understanding the key components of an optimization model is critical when reviewing formulations and code generated by a custom GPT.  

The main components of an optimization model are:

- **Decision Variables:** The set of variables representing the choice that must be made.  For example, 'production rate' or 'machine on/off status'. Note that a variables' allowed set of values can be continuous (i.e., any number in a specified range), integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.), or binary (i.e., 0 or 1). 
- **Constraints:** Constraints define relationships between the values of the variables that must be satisfied for set of decision to be considered feasible. They can represent tradeoffs and limitations that must be accounted for, and criteria that must be satisfied. For example, 'no more than 3 workers scheduled any day' or 'at least 100 units in inventory at all times'.  
- **Objective:** The goal of your application. For example, 'minimize cost' or 'maximize reliability'. 
- **Parameters and Data:** The input data required to not just run the model, but to make the model represent exactly the situation at hand.  For example, 'price of '


Translation of Problem Statement into Mathematical Formulation: Two Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two options: construct the model by hand, or with assistance from ChatGPT.
We will describe and contrast both approaches...

Review, Validate and Iterate

However the model was constructed, we will still need to review the results ...
