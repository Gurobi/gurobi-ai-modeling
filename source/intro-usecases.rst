Use cases
=========

For this section we have tried to come up with use cases for some of the specialties in the Software Engineering domain.

We think it is important to give some specific examples so users new to optimization know what to look for.

.. note::
   Not only **can** these scenarios be applied in the real-world, they **are** applied in the real world... by us! For
   :ref:`example <testing_strategy>`, in our CI/CD process we utilize optimization to smartly select which machines to run tests on and what kind
   of testing environment to setup. So we are using Gurobi to optimize the development process at Gurobi!

DevOps Engineer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As a DevOps Engineer you are likely encountering optimization problems on a frequent basis. Resources, be it cloud or
on-prem are never infinite as they can be constrained by, for instance, cost or availability.

Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) and Linear Programming (LP) models can help enhance resource allocation,
task scheduling, and overall system performance, leading to more efficient CI/CD pipelines and cost-effective cloud
resource management. For instance, think about the following questions:

-

Backend Engineer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A software engineer can leverage mathematical optimization to streamline complex decision-making and enhance system performance in various practical applications. By implementing optimization algorithms, engineers can efficiently solve problems like resource allocation, scheduling, and logistics. For instance, in cloud computing, optimization models can minimize operational costs by dynamically adjusting server loads based on demand. In supply chain management, these techniques can reduce transportation costs and improve delivery times by finding optimal routing paths. Optimization also plays a critical role in machine learning, where it aids in hyperparameter tuning, ensuring model accuracy and efficiency. By integrating mathematical optimization into their development workflow, software engineers can deliver solutions that are both cost-effective and high-performing across diverse domains.

Professions outside of the Software Engineering domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Even though this repository is primarily aimed at Software Engineers, don't let preconceived notions inhibit you,
optimization can be applied in many ways that people have not yet thought of!

Below are a few professions with applications to illustrate the wide range of potential applications:

- **Fitness Coaches**: Fitness coaches can use optimization to design personalized workout plans. By optimizing exercise routines based on individual goals, fitness levels, and available time, they can help clients achieve their fitness objectives more efficiently.
- **Real Estate Developers**: Real estate developers can use optimization to determine the best use of land plots. By considering factors like zoning laws, market demand, and construction costs, they can maximize the return on investment for a given property.
- **Mechanical Engineers**: Mechanical engineers can use optimization for component design. By optimizing the design parameters of mechanical parts (e.g., minimizing weight while maximizing strength), they can improve performance and reduce material costs.
- **E-commerce Managers**: E-commerce managers can use optimization for dynamic pricing and inventory management. By optimizing prices based on demand and inventory levels, they can maximize revenue and minimize stockouts or overstock situations.
- **Farmers**: Farmers can use optimization for crop rotation and planting schedules. By optimizing the sequence and timing of planting different crops, they can improve soil health and maximize yields.
- **Green Energy Consultants**: Consultants can use optimization for designing renewable energy systems. By optimizing the placement and capacity of solar panels or wind turbines, they can maximize energy production and minimize costs.
- **Television Network Schedulers**: Network schedulers can use optimization to determine the best time slots for different shows. By optimizing the broadcast schedule based on viewer ratings and advertising revenue, they can maximize audience engagement and profits.
- **Electrical Engineers**: Electrical engineers can use optimization for circuit design. By optimizing the arrangement and values of components in an electrical circuit, they can achieve desired performance characteristics such as minimizing power consumption or maximizing signal integrity.
