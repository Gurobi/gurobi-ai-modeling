DevOps Engineer
===============

As a DevOps Engineer you are likely encountering optimization problems on a frequent basis. Resources, be it cloud or
on-prem are never infinite, even though we would like it to be. Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) and Linear Programming
(LP) models can help enhance resource allocation, task scheduling, and overall system performance, leading to more
efficient CI/CD pipelines and cost-effective cloud resource management.

Below are a few ideas where optimization can be applied in a typical DevOps Engineer's daily responsibilities:

- **Infrastructure Cost Optimization**: Managing and optimizing cloud infrastructure costs by selecting the most cost-effective configurations and pricing plans for various workloads.
- **Testing strategy optimization**: Smartly decide which machines to run tests on and what kind of testing environment to simulate.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery Planning**: Optimizing the backup schedules and disaster recovery plans to minimize downtime and data loss while balancing the costs of backup storage and recovery infrastructure.
