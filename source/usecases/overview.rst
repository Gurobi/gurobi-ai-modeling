Use cases
=========

In this section we have tried to come up with use cases for some of the specialties in the Software Engineering domain.

We think it is important to give some specific examples so users new to optimization know what to look for.

.. note::
   Not only **can** these scenarios be applied in the real-world, they **are** applied in the real world... by us! For
   example, in our CI/CD process we utilize optimization to smartly select which machines to run tests on and what kind
   of testing environment to setup. So we are using Gurobi to optimize the development process at Gurobi!
