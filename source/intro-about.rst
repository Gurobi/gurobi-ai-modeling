About this repository
======================

Welcome to ``gurobi-ai-modeling``. This repository aims to guide users to get familiar with using generative AI for
mathematical modeling. We feel that generative AI poses a unique opportunity for users in domains that encounter
optimization problems in their daily work, but do not have knowledge how optimization can be applied in the practical
sense (or even that it exists!). Our aim is to introduce optimization to Software Engineers in a language more native to them.

How to utilize this repository
------------------------------
``gurobi-ai-modeling`` is mostly focused on the documentation you are now reading. On the left pane, there is a list of
sections. We recommend going through them in order for the most applied, hands-on experience. The aim is to create an
understanding of what type of daily problems are actually optimization problems, show how they can be solved using
a solver like Gurobi, and spark interest, leading the user to learn more about optimization.

Structure
---------
This repository is divided into the following parts:

- **Use Cases**: Inspiration on how optimization can help solve problems in the daily work of Engineers.
  It should be enough to read the one page that closest reflects your daily role.
- **Prompting**: How to use Generative AI to guide you with writing and solving your first problem.
- **Modeling Basics**: Create a basic understanding of the components of an optimization model
- **Evaluation and troubleshooting**: A practical approach to testing and troubleshooting the models

What to take away from this
---------------------------
todo: after getting your feet wet, observe the current processes and look for opportunities where optimization can be applied.
