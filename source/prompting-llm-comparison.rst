LLM comparison and accuracy
===========================

.. attention::

   This is obviously a fast-moving field, be mindful that the results on this page can be outdated. If you find any
   errors, please open a Github Issue or open a PR.


Talk about some different LLM's, which are capable of:

- running code
- reading files
- "custom gpt"

Also:

- put some kind of metric showing how often a model generates a good/faulty model. This should both show which LLM is
  better as well as signal to the users that you should not blindly trust the generated model.
