In many cases, LLMs have impressed us with their technological prowess. In arguably more cases, they have surprised us
with their interesting mishaps. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly why an LLM gets something wrong. Moreover,
an LLM getting something wrong can often catch us by surprise. In this chapter we will share a few case studies where we
were caught off-guard by its inability to generate a correct model. Note that we do not mention any particular LLM, but
very often we see that unexpected behavior is not confined to only one of the different cutting-edge LLM offerings.
