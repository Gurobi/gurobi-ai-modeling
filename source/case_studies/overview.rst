Case studies
============

.. _case_studies:

In many cases, LLMs have impressed us with their technological prowess. In arguably more cases, they have surprised us
with their interesting mishaps. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly why an LLM gets something wrong. Moreover,
an LLM getting something wrong can often catch us by surprise. In this chapter we will share a few case studies where we
were caught off-guard by its inability to generate a correct model.

.. note::

   As it happens, OpenAI recently released the ``o1-preview`` model. In our limited testing of ``o1-preview``, we found
   that ChatGPT is able to solve practically all use cases discussed in the coming sections. We will leave the current
   pages in place not only because ``o1-preview`` does not yet support Code Interpreter or Custom GPTs, but because we
   think it still gives a valuable insight into how LLMs sometimes upend our expectations.
