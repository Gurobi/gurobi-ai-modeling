In many cases, LLMs have impressed us with the their technological prowess. In arguably
many more cases, they have surprised us with their stupidity. It is difficult to pinpoint
exactly why an LLM gets something wrong. Moreover, an LLM getting something wrong can often
catch us by surprise. In this chapter we will share a few case studies where we were caught
off-guard by its inability to generate a correct model. Note that we do not mention any
particular LLM, but very often we see that unexpected behavior is not confined to only one of
the cutting-edge LLM offerings.
